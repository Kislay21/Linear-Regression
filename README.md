# LINEAR REGRESSION- Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.

1) First Regression- It is an example of simple Linear Regression model to predict the SAT score of students on the basis of their College GPA. 
    Tools:- Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib, Statsmodel, Seaborn.
    
    
2) Second Regression- It is an example of Linear regression Model to Predict The Price of 'Real-Estate values' on the basis of their Size. 
      Tools:- Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib, Statsmodel.
      
      
3) Linear Regression Practical Example- It is an advance example of Linear regression model used to predict the Price of a Car on various parameter. The example includes Data preprocessing  of different parameters and finally creating a regression model.
         Tools:- Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib, Statsmodel, Seaborn.
         
         
 4) Regression using Sk-Learn - In this example, we have used the same dataset used to predict SAT on the basis of GPA. It introduces some new parameters that are used in sklearn.
       Tools:- Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
       
       
 -> MULTIPLE REGRESSION- Multiple regression is an extension of simple linear regression. It is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more other variables. The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes, the outcome, target or criterion variable). The variables we are using to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the independent variables (or sometimes, the predictor, explanatory or regressor variables)
 
 5)  Multiple Regression- It is an extended version of simple linear regression model to predict the SAT scores on the more than one parameters. 
              Tools:- Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
              
              
 6) Multiple linear regression example - It is an extended version of linear-model used to predict the price of the 'Real-estate properties' on the basis of size and year.
                 Tools:- Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
